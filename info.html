<p>We have made this site in order to provide students and teachers with some exciting programming material. Here whoever interested in learning coding will be able to find useful tutorials and practice exercises  concerning four of the most common programming languages (scratch, java, c++, python). Hope that you will enjoy our website and have a unique learning experience!</p>
<p>Below there are some infrormations about the four program languages displayed on the menu.</p>

    <p>With Scratch, you can program your own interactive stories, games, and animations — and share your creations with others in the online community.Scratch helps young people learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively — essential skills for life in the 21st century.</p>
<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
<p>Python is another highly recommended language for beginners, and is the most popular introductory language at Top U.S. Universities.
Developers have used Python to build desktop apps and web apps alike, and it has great tools for data mining. In addition, Python is particularly popular in academic communities for scientific computing, data analysis, and bioinformatics.</p>
<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
<p>As a general-purpose language, Java is used to build Android apps, desktop apps, and games. Java is also commonly used as a server-side language for enterprise-level back-end development - 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies use Java.

Furthermore, Hadoop is a popular Java-based framework used for storing and processing big data, and is implemented by enterprises such as Yahoo, Facebook, and Amazon Web Services.</p>
<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
<p>C++ is a powerful language based on C. It is designed for programming systems software, but has also been used to build games/game engines, desktop apps, mobile apps, and web apps. C++ is powerful and fast — even Facebook has developed several high performance and high reliability components with it.

Many softwares have been built with C++, including Adobe Systems, Amazon, Paypal, Chrome, and more. Much like C, C++ is generally considered harder for beginners to learn on their own. So, if you decide to learn C++ as your first programming language, feel free to look for a mentor via Meetups or find a C++ Codementor.</p>
